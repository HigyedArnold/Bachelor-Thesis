Sale account to be initialized with funds:

truffle console
EduScienceTokenSale.deployed().then(function(i) {tokenSale=i;});
EduScienceToken.deployed().then(function(i) {token = i;});
tokensAvailable = 750000; admin = web3.eth.accounts[0];
token.transfer(tokenSale.address, tokensAvailable, {from: admin});
.exit

-> accounts[0] is the deployer of the contracts, gets all the allocated coins!

bytes32 -> string/data over 32 characters are dropped in Solidity -> no security measures are needed for it.
Contracts were designed to check for overflow.
